<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antilock Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tetraethyllead [TEL]</li><li>MMT</li><li>Ferrocene</li><li>Iron Pentacarbonyl</li><li>Toluene</li><li>2,2,4-Trimethylpentane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antilock agents in the automotive and industrial markets are additives that improve fuel performance and reduce engine knocking. Tetraethyllead (TEL) was historically used for its anti-knock properties but is now largely phased out due to environmental concerns. MMT (methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl) serves a similar purpose. Ferrocene enhances octane rating, while iron pentacarbonyl offers a less toxic alternative. Toluene is a solvent that also enhances fuel quality, and 2,2,4-trimethylpentane is a high-octane reference fuel used for standardizing octane ratings.</p></p>
