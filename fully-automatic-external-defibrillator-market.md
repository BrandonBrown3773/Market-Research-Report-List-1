<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fully Automatic External Defibrillator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-synchronous Defibrillator</li><li>Synchronous Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Fully Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) market is segmented into non-synchronous and synchronous defibrillators. Non-synchronous defibrillators deliver shocks without regard to the heart's rhythm, making them user-friendly for laypersons. Conversely, synchronous defibrillators synchronize the shock with the heart's electrical activity to prevent further complications, primarily used in clinical settings by trained professionals. Both types aim to restore normal heart rhythm during cardiac emergencies, but their operational contexts and user expertise differ significantly.</p></p>
